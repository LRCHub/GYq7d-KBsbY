[00:06.99] The time has come
[00:11.30] To pack away all the joys
[00:18.36] You don't wanna hear my apology
[00:21.35] Get it off my chest
[00:22.95] I would do my best
[00:24.34] I know what you fear
[00:25.95] Similarities we possess
[00:37.45] 
[00:30.18] Never will I pass the test
[00:34.25] The scene is fading
[00:36.11] Can my soul be put to rest?
[00:49.61] 
[00:41.28] Death is gonna come for me
[00:44.22] Be the change I couldn't be
[00:47.23] Can you find a life that's like fairy tales?
[00:51.05] Far from this tragedy
[00:53.17] Sad you had to wait for me
[00:56.17] Feels like an eternity
[00:59.10] Please forgive me for my sins
[01:01.48] Angels wings lifting and setting me free
[01:21.48] 
[01:17.03] Death is gonna come for me
[01:20.22] Be the change I couldn't be
[01:23.29] Can you find a life that's like fairy tales?
[01:27.09] Far from this tragedy
[01:29.20] Sad you had to wait for me
[01:32.21] Feels like an eternity
[01:35.16] Please forgive me for my sins
[01:37.53] Angels wings lifting and setting me free
[01:57.53] 
[01:41.67] The question of my love
[01:47.12] Slipping right through the cracks
[01:50.75] And crumbling to dust
[01:53.75] The question of my love
[01:59.08] Slipping right through the cracks
[02:02.87] And crumbling to dust
